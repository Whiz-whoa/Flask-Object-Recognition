# Flask Object Recognition
 An object recognition algorithm that runs on a flask web app

# Method of working
the backend is created using the "Flask" micro web framework written for python
the object recognition algorithm is an already existing "YOLO v8" trained model, which is an open source model available online
the front end is written using HTML (tentatively) and linked to the flask backend using the jinja2 syntax
the object is recognised from the pre existing trained data set, and the text is converted to speech using the gTTS package
